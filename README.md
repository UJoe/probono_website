# probono_website
This is the first reference website created by my team "Frontend Warriors" for an existing fundation. What you can see here is the "surface" of the website: the design, menus, functions are visible and clickable, but there is neither real data transfer, nor real photos used. This is our intellectual property, so don't use any part of the code!
